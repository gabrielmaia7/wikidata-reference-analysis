    "3. \"The \\\"Podemos\\\" (last reference) is kinda a tricky one, since \\\"Podemos\\\" is a party but it's acronym is the one that shows in the website being \\\"PTN\\\", so people might get the wrong idea and say that it the object \\\"podemos\\\" doesn't show up in the page, when it actually does, but with a different name.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "With this feedback, here's what we can conclude for the reasons workers might claim information is either inaccessible or irrelevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Surface forms**: When things are the *same entity* but with *different names*, workers might consider it irrelevant or relevant based on personal opinion, e.g. feedbacks 1, 3, 4, 39\n",
    "\t- This includes when things are the same but in *different languages*, e.g. feedbacks 8, \n",
    "\t- This also includes *nicknames* or when names are lacking, e.g. feedback 9, 22 \n",
    "\t- This also includes *slight variations*, e.g. feedback 19, 40, 41\n",
    "\t- This even includes errors, e.g. feedback 39\n",
    "    - Stretching the concept a bit: When the object is an URL, if the URLs in the reference is not the same but *what they represent is*, workers might consider it relevant, e.g. feedback 2\n",
    "- **Learning curve**: Workers might not find information at a specific domain on one task, but find it later after learning how to navigate it, e.g. feedback 5\n",
    "- **Insufficient proof**: Workers might want more convincing or explicit proof of the statements than what's in the reference, e.g. feedbacks 6, 17, 18, 26, 31, 44, 45\n",
    "- **Insufficient information**: Information in references sometimes is partial, e.g. feedbacks 24, 25, 27, 34\n",
    "- **Insufficient context**: Some references lack context for workers to understand, e.g. feedback 35\n",
    "- **Use of common sense**: Workers might dispute or confirm the information based on their common sense, e.g. feedback 20, 21, 23, 27, 29, 36, 43, 45\n",
    "- **Date format mismatch**: Wikidata sometimes puts only *years* as dates, but used predicates such as 'inception' or 'creation'. When the reference carries the whole date, workers might disagree because, while the year is correct, the day and month is not mentioned in the object. e.g. feedback 10\n",
    "\t- The opposite might happen too, if the object in Wikidata contains the full date but the reference only has the year, e.g. feedbacks 24, 25, 46\n",
    "- **Wrong or missing information**: Some information is *simply wrong or missing*, e.g. feedback 11, 14, 21, 33, 34, 37, 38, 42\n",
    "- **Slightly wrong identifiers**: Some IDs are given as incorrect by workers for *minor differences*, e.g. feedbacks 15, 20\n",
    "- **Worker misunderstanding**: Workers might wrongly think that the object should contain *all possible answers* or *the most correct answer* to the subject-predicate question , e.g. feedback 12, 16\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to notice that when not able to find the information:\n",
    "- Some workers might seek information on their and find it elsewhere, e.g. feedbacks 7, 30, 32\n",
    "- Some workers might instead give up at the first redirection, e.g. feedback 28"

    "With everything considered, the annotations look healthy and with no major conflicts that could not be excused by subjectivity or difference in connection time or origin (e.g. 404 at one case, normal service at the other, or being able to access geonames or not due to security issues).\n",

    "The only links that need reviewing for the ML part are the tools.wmflabs.org links in regards to author/publisher. This is due to workers having no context to classify them, but us having it.\n",

    "\n",
    "## References voted inaccessible in Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "References deemed inaccessible in this group are either:\n",
    "- A search page (or a redirect to it)\n",
    "- A redirect to a home page\n",
    "- Security issues\n",
    "- A 404 at some point (either told by workers or faced by us at some point)\n",
    "- Discontinued service\n",
    "- Is a JSON: Some JSONs are reported 'not structured' by workers and information in them might be impossible or hard to understand or retrieve, prompting some workers to say it is inaccessible.\n",
    "- Permission errors\n",
    "- Payment required\n",

    "- Discontinued service: Workers might not assume that the host of the service is the author/publisher and deem the reference inaccessible\n",
    "- Is a JSON (tools.wmflabs.org): JSONs from tools.wmflabs have no indication of what author/publisher created them and the URL does not give much indication of it, nor do they provide a home page. The only way to conclude would be to know it is a wiki project, or to access the base url manually.\n",

    "- Discontinued service: Information inaccessible, but author/publisher obvious, i.e. http://talent.yahoo.co.jp/pf/detail/pp13199. This is very subjective, as whether or not Yahoo was the author/publisher or if it was only hosting it is concluded by each worker through their own reasoning. This prompts them to classify this discontinued service as either inaccessible in Task 2 or to use Yahoo as author/publisher and deem it accessible.\n",
